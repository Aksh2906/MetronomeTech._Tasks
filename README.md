**Task 1**

 Create a square room with top angle view (can be 2d or 3d). Place the thief in the center of the
room.
 Now randomly instantiate 10 cops in the same room. No one should overlap each other and
there should be required space between each person. Make sure each person is instantiated
inside the room only. 

**Task 2**

 Finding the best possible direction in which the thief should run so that he has
maximum chances of reaching the boundary of the room.

 Representing this direction using a line renderer.

Setup-
1. Thief(RedColored) and cop(GreenColored) could be simple capsules or boxes. 
2. Thief’s position is fixed. Use 'R' to randomize positions of cops.
3. Use 'S' find and draw the direction
